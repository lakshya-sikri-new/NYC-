# NYC-

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and feature engineering process conducted on the Airbnb NYC Dataset. The project aims to derive actionable insights and optimize strategies for hosts by exploring pricing, neighborhood popularity, room type demand, and availability trends.

# Data Preprocessing
This section outlines the steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values in reviews_per_month with 0 to represent no reviews.
Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identified and removed outliers in price and availability to ensure robust analysis.
Data Formatting: Standardized column names and ensured consistent formats for categorical variables.
Scaling: Applied scaling techniques (Min-Max and Standard Scaler) to numerical data for better compatibility with machine learning algorithms.


# Key Features of the Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Investigated missing values, outliers, and data distribution.
Visualized trends using matplotlib and seaborn with eye-catching color schemes.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features such as distance from central Manhattan, price categories, and review-to-listing ratios.
Interaction features (e.g., price_per_night, review_density) to capture combined effects of variables.
Feature Transformation:

Scaled numerical variables using Min-Max and Standard scaling.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
Insights Derived:

Identified the most popular neighborhoods and room types.
Analyzed price variations across neighborhoods and their impact on reviews and availability.
Evaluated host activity metrics (e.g., top 3 hosts by listings and reviews).



# Problem Statement
The NYC Airbnb provides a detailed view of short-term rental trends, offering an opportunity to explore the key drivers of pricing, availability, and customer preferences. This project aims to perform advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to uncover the factors influencing price variations across neighborhoods, room types, and host activity levels. By analyzing host engagement, such as reviews and the number of listings, and creating new features to capture price dynamics, this analysis seeks to provide deeper insights into pricing trends and their relationship with demand. The results will deliver actionable strategies for hosts to optimize pricing, enhance listing visibility, and increase profitability, while also offering data-driven recommendations for improving platform-level pricing models and customer satisfaction.

This study aims to address these challenges by conducting a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in NYC. Through this, the study seeks to uncover trends and patterns in neighborhood distribution, pricing, and availability and listing availability, this study seeks to provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts and The findings will provide valuable insights to help optimize listings, improve traveler experiences, and support the sustainable growth of the Airbnb market in NYC.

# Objective
The objective of this analysis is to uncover the factors influencing the pricing variations of Airbnb listings by examining neighborhood characteristics, room types, and specific listing features. We aim to explore how neighborhood group and location impact pricing and popularity, while also evaluating the role of host engagement, including host ID and the number of listings, in determining pricing, reviews, and overall performance. Additionally, the analysis will assess customer preferences by examining room types and booking trends to identify patterns that contribute to listing success. By analyzing the availability of listings throughout the year (availability_365), we will uncover trends in booking behaviors and their relationship to pricing and demand. Ultimately, these insights will help optimize pricing strategies and improve host performance.

# About The Dataset
The Airbnb NYC dataset is a widely utilized dataset that provides detailed information about short-term rental listings across New York City. It is commonly used for exploratory data analysis, geospatial analysis, and predictive modeling. This dataset offers insights into various factors influencing rental prices, availability, and host behaviors. The target variable often analyzed is price, which represents the nightly cost of a listing. Other key features include location details such as neighbourhood_group (borough) and neighbourhood, property characteristics like room_type, and host-specific metrics such as number_of_reviews and reviews_per_month.

The dataset includes demographic, temporal, and geographic attributes that describe listings comprehensively. For example, availability_365 provides information on the annual availability of a listing, while minimum_nights captures the host's minimum stay requirement. Temporal features like last_review help track listing activity over time. Geospatial attributes such as latitude and longitude enable mapping and location-based analysis.

Airbnb NYC data includes both continuous variables (e.g., price, number_of_reviews) and categorical variables (e.g., room_type, neighbourhood_group), with potential missing values in fields like reviews_per_month and last_review, necessitating data cleaning. The dataset is valuable for understanding rental trends, identifying neighborhood popularity, detecting pricing anomalies, and analyzing how factors like room type, location, and availability impact rental success.

# Tools and Technologies

# Conclusion From Analysis
The analysis of the Airbnb dataset has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing pricing, availability, and customer preferences. By examining the relationship between key variables such as neighborhood group, room type, price, and availability, we uncovered trends that can help optimize pricing strategies and enhance host performance. Neighborhood popularity and room type demand were identified as significant drivers of price variations, while host engagement metrics revealed the importance of managing reviews and listing activity effectively. Seasonal and geographical patterns in availability further emphasize the need for dynamic pricing strategies to maximize occupancy and revenue. Overall, this analysis equips hosts with actionable insights to remain competitive in their markets while catering to customer preferences and improving overall listing performance.
